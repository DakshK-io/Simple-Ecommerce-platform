## ✨ Features

* **Dynamic Content Rendering:** Products are stored in a JavaScript array and injected into the HTML dynamically, making it easy to add or remove items without duplicating HTML code.
* **Modern UI & Animations:** Features a sleek gradient hero section, smooth hover effects on product cards (lifting up and zooming), and cascading fade-in animations.
* **Fully Responsive:** Utilizes the Bootstrap 5 grid system to ensure the store looks perfect on mobile phones, tablets, and desktop screens.
* **Clean Code Architecture:** The project is modularly split into separate HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files for excellent readability and maintainability.

* **`style.css`**: Custom styling that handles the gradient backgrounds, smooth scrolling, layout spacing, and all hover/loading animations.
